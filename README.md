# undesign

**un-zoom websites that think it's good design to make everything really big and spaced out**

as we all know, this can just be done by hitting "CMD + -" a few times, but it's not something I usually remember to
do until I'm already annoyed &mdash; which I want to avoid.  

undesign is a chrome extension.
